      <p id="welcome"> Welcome to the world of Syxienna, where imagination is the only tool that will get you out of any and every situation. We are all excited to welcome you, and we hope that you have a good time.The creator has already started the story, in fact she's started many but it's up to you to choose one to embark on. Before going further you may want to suspend your sense of disbelief and charge up your imagination because with it present in your mind you won't see a fourth of the things you must to survive. </p>
